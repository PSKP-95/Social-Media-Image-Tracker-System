        <p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 25px">As the name suggests, Image Steganography refers to
            the process of hiding data within an image file.
            The image selected for this purpose is called the cover-image
            and the image obtained after steganography is called the stego-image.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-family: serif; font-size: 25px">
            How is it done?
        </h3>
        <p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 25px">
            An image is represented as an N*M (in case of greyscale images) or
            N*M*3 (in case of colour images) matrix in memory, with each entry
            representing the intensity value of a pixel. In image steganography,
            a message is embedded into an image by altering the values of some pixels,
            which are chosen by an encryption algorithm. The recipient of the image
            must be aware of the same algorithm in order to known which pixels he or
            she must select to extract the message.
